# Image-Recognization-Classifiers-based-on-CNNs
Built a Deep Learning model (based on Neural Networks) that provides reliable and improved accuracy of  an Image Recognition Classifier based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). For comparing and contrasting, device two CNNs models:  A Keras Sequential model with multiple Convolution and MaxPooling layers, and Make use of a pre-trained model
